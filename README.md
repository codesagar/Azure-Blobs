A simple Python flask application to upload files to Azure Blob

**Steps**

1. Go to Azure management portal and create a Storage Account
2. Find the api access key from the azure storage dashboard
3. Copy paste the account name and api key in the python script
4. Write a container name of your wish
5. Run the requirements file to install the required dependencies
6. Run the python flask app locally to get access no the upload page

Now you can select any file from your system and upload to the designated Azure Blob. Once the upload is completed, the system will return a url for future access.

__Note__ - Larger files may take longer to upload
